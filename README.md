# The Entelo Clojure Club 
Minutes, documentation and resources for the Entelo Clojure Study Group*

###### *Are you a software engineer who wants to learn clojure but you're not a part of Entelo? You're in luck! [We're hiring!](https://www.entelo.com/company/careers/job-openings/)

## Statement of Sincerest Purpose
The Entelo Clojure Club exists for a myriad of goals, including but not limited to:
* Supporting Entelo's vision for employee career growth and lifelong education
* Making our engineering org better at engineering by challenging ourselves to think about problems in new or unfamiliar paradigms
* Ensuring that should our most esteemed architects ever depart or get hit by a bus (perish the thought) that there's a clojure corps ready and able to assist in maintaining the existing parts of the stack that utilize clojure
* Allowing for clojure to be a viable option should we end up with other compelling use cases for it

## Q1 Goals
* TBD
